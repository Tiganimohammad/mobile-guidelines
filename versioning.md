# Versioning

It is better to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Summary
```
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
```
For example, a software version `1.2.3` means:
'1': a MAJOR version
'2': a MINOR version
'3': a PATCH version
