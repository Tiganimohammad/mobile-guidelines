# Code Styles

**There are many code styles out there and they are somehow similar or a little bit different to each other.
But I find that two following guidelines work well for me up to now.**
* Java & Android: [Square's Java code styles](https://github.com/mcrafts/java-code-styles).
* iOS(Swift): [Raywenderlich's Swift code styles](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide).
* Kotlin: [Kotlin official coding convention](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html)  

## Common code styles
They maybe different with one or two above styles but they are used explicitly at a higher priority.    
* Indentation: Always 2 spaces.  
* Naming  
  * CamelCase for type and camelCase for others (variable, method or function).
  * Say **"No"** to Hungarian notation (i.e: use `private String name` instead of `private String mName`).  
  * ... (updating)

The main reason is that they share many styles in common. 
Therefore, it keeps the consistency and readability when switching between Android and iOS developement.
