# Code Styles

**There are many code styles out there and they are somehow similar or a little bit different to each other.
But I find that two following guidelines work well for me up to now.**
* Android: [Square's Java code styles](https://github.com/mcrafts/java-code-styles).
* iOS(Swift): [Raywenderlich's Swift code styles](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide).

The main reason is that they share many styles in common. 
Therefore, it keeps the consistency and readability when switching between Android and iOS developement.
