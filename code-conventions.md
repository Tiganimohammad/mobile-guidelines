# Code conventions

### Why Need Code Conventions?
> Code conventions are important to programmers for a number of reasons:
> * 80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance.
> * Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the original author.
> * Code conventions improve the readability of the software, allowing engineers to
understand new code more quickly and thoroughly.
> * If you ship your source code as a product, you need to make sure it is as well packaged
and clean as any other product you create.

## Android and iOS Code Styles
* Android: [Android code styles](/android-code-conventions.md).
* iOS(Swift): Follow [Raywenderlich's Swift code styles](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide).

The above code conventions share many styles in common, so it keeps the consistency and readability when switching between Android and iOS developement. For example.
* Indentation: 2 spaces.
* Naming  
  * CamelCase for type and camelCase for others (variable, method or function).
  * Say **"No"** to Hungarian notation (i.e: use `private String name` instead of `private String mName`).  
  * ...
